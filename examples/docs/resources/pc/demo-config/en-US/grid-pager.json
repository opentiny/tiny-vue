The paging component needs to be introduced to the paging function. The built-in paging configuration procedure is as follows: \n1. <code>import</code> introduces the official <code>Pager</code> component. That is, <code>import Pager from '@opentiny/vue-pager'</code> or <code>{Pager} from '@opentiny/vue'</code>. \n2. <code>Pager</code> is transferred to the <code>data()</code> function and stored for use in the template. \n3. Set the table attribute <code>pager</code> to configure pagination and inject the pagination component through the <code>{component: Pager}</code> attribute of <code>pager</code>. \n4. Configure the seq-serial attribute to set the sequence number to be displayed consecutively after page turning. By default, the sequence number is displayed discontinuously.</p>\n",
