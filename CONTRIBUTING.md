# Contributing

We are glad that you are willing to contribute to the TinyVue open source project. There are many forms of contribution, and you can choose one or more of them according to your strengths and interests:

- Report [new defect](https://github.com/opentiny/tiny-vue/issues/new?template=bug-report.yml)
- Provide more detailed information for [existing defects](https://github.com/opentiny/tiny-vue/labels/bug), such as supplementary screenshots, more detailed reproduction steps, minimum reproducible demo links, etc.
- Submit Pull requests to fix typos in the document or make the document clearer and better
- Add the official assistant WeChat `opentiny-official` and join the technical exchange group to participate in the discussion.

When you personally use the TinyVue component library and participate in many of the above contributions, as you become familiar with TinyVue, you can try to do something more challenging, such as:

- Fix defects, you can start with [Good-first issue](https://github.com/opentiny/tiny-vue/labels/good%20first%20issue).
- Implement new features.
- Improve unit testing.
- Translate the document.
- Participate in code review.

## Bug Reports

If you encounter problems in the process of using TinyVue components, you are welcome to submit Issue to us. Before submitting Issue, please read the relevant [official documentation](https://opentiny.design) carefully to confirm whether this is a defect or an unimplemented function.

If it is a defect, select [Bug report](https://github.com/opentiny/tiny-vue/issues/new?template=bug-report.yml) template when creating a new Issue. The title follows the format of `[componentName] defect description`. For example: `[select] filtering function, the selected option cannot be selected again after it has been deleted`.

Issue that reports defects mainly needs to fill in the following information:

- Version numbers of `@opentiny/vue` and `vue`.
- The performance of the defect can be illustrated by screenshot, and if there is an error, the error message can be posted.
- Defect reproduction step, preferably with a minimum reproducible demo link.

If it is a new feature, select [Feature request](https://github.com/opentiny/tiny-vue/issues/new?template=feature-request.yml) template. The title follows the format of `[componentName] new feature description`. For example: `[select] selection box is too long to display, hope to support the configuration of tips prompt`.

The following information is required for the Issue of the new feature:

- What problems does this feature mainly solve for users?
- What is the api of this feature?

## Pull Requests

Before submitting pull request, please make sure that your submission is in line with the overall plan of TinyVue. Generally, issues that marked as [bug](https://github.com/opentiny/tiny-vue/labels/bug) are encouraged to submit pull requests. If you are not sure, you can create a [Discussion](https://github.com/opentiny/tiny-vue/discussions) for discussion.

### Pull Request Specification

#### Commit Message

The commit message should be in the form of a `type(scope): description of the message`, e.g. `fix(vue-renderless): [scrollbar, action-menu] fix xxx bug`.

1. type: must be one of build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, release, style, test, improvement.

2. scope.

- Package names in the `packages` directory, e.g. `vue-design-aurora, vue-design-saas, react ......`
- Component name under the package name in the `packages` directory, e.g., `vue-design-aurora/alert, vue-design-saas/alert, react/alert ......`
- The name of the folder to use: e.g.: `gulp, internals/playwright-config, sites`
- The name of the component (lowercase, center dot): e.g.: `action-menu, alert ......`

#### Pull Request Title

1. The specification of the title is the same as the commit information, which is entered in the form of `type(scope): description information`.

2. **e2e test** of trigger components: Adding '[componentName1, componentName2]' to the Pull Request title will execute test cases for componentName1, componentName2, and declare this structure when changes to code affect components.

   - Note: The `github action` in this project identifies test e2e use cases to be executed by matching the component names declared by `[componentName1, componentName2]` with the path names in the `examples/sites/demos` directory. (Because running the full test case is too time consuming)

   - When modifying a sub-component of a component, such as the `col` component, which has no corresponding examples and test cases, the `layout` component should be tested, because the `col` component is a sub-component of the `layout` component. The PR title can be: `fix(col): [layout] xxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

3. Example title:

- Supplement alert component document: `docs(alert): [alert] xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`, `docs(site): [alert] xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
- Supplement alet component test case: `test(alert): [alert] xxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
- Fixed bug in alet component @opentiny/vue-renderless: `fix(vue-renderless/alert): [alert] xxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

#### Pull Request Description

The PR description uses a template, and it is necessary to fill in the relevant information of the PR according to the template, mainly including:

- PR Checklist: Whether the Commit information is compliant with the specifications, whether it supplements the E2E test cases, and whether it supplements the documentation
- PR Type: Bugfix / Feature / Code style update / Refactoring and so on
- Issue Number
- Does this PR introduce a breaking change?
